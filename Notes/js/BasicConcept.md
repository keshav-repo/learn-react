## Difference between between var, let 

The main differences between `var` and `let` in JavaScript are in their scoping and hoisting behaviors:

1. Scoping:
   - `var` has function-level scope. It is scoped to the nearest function block and is accessible throughout the entire function, even outside of conditional blocks.
   - `let` has block-level scope. It is scoped to the nearest enclosing block, such as a loop or conditional statement, and is not accessible outside of that block.

2. Hoisting:
   - `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can access a variable declared with `var` before its actual declaration in the code. However, the value assigned to it will be `undefined` until the assignment statement is reached.
   - `let` declarations are not hoisted. They follow the normal top-to-bottom execution order. You can only access a `let` variable after its declaration in the code.

Here's an example to illustrate the differences:

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log(x); // Output: undefined
  var x = 'Hello';

  if (true) {
    var y = 'World';
    let z = '!';
    console.log(y); // Output: World
    console.log(z); // Output: !
  }

  console.log(y); // Output: World
  console.log(z); // Error: z is not defined
}

example();
```

In this example, `var` is hoisted to the top of the function scope, so the variable `x` is accessible throughout the function. However, its value is `undefined` until the assignment statement is reached.

Inside the `if` block, both `var y` and `let z` are declared. `var y` is accessible outside the block due to its function-level scope, while `let z` is block-scoped and can only be accessed within the block.

Outside the `if` block, `y` is accessible because of `var` hoisting, but `z` is not defined since it is block-scoped and only accessible within the block.

In general, it is recommended to use `let` and `const` instead of `var` due to their block-level scoping and more predictable behavior. `let` provides better control over variable scoping and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.
